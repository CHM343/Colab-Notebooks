# Colab Notebooks

[Google Colaboratory]([https://www.google.com](https://colab.google/)) - Colab is a hosted [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) service that requires no setup to use and provides free access to computing resources, including GPUs and TPUs. Colab is especially well suited to data science and education. Google Colab can be freely accessed at [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/).

This repository will be used to provide tutorials, examples, templates and a general collection of [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) files (.ipynb is the common file extension used for ipython / jupyter / colab files).
